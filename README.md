## üõ†Ô∏è Design Overview

The housing is composed of two CNC-machined aluminum parts, which are **screwed together into an L-shaped configuration**. The **shorter side of the L** is designed to house a standard 22 mm push-button emergency stop, while the **longer side** provides surface area for mounting to the machine.

To achieve a clean external appearance and eliminate any protruding components or visible fasteners, an **acrylic cover** was added. This panel is mounted on standoffs, offset from the aluminum housing, effectively **concealing all internal mounting features** while allowing the emergency button to remain fully exposed and accessible.

This combination of mechanical strength, manufacturability, and visual cleanliness ensures the module integrates seamlessly into safety-critical machines where both form and function are essential.

## üß© Design Considerations

- **Material Choice**:  
  - **Aluminum**: Used for its high stiffness, ease of CNC machining, and light weight.  
  - **Acrylic**: Selected for its aesthetic finish, machinability via laser cutting, and low cost.

- **Machinability**:  
  The L-shaped housing was split into two components to simplify CNC operations and improve access to critical features.

- **Modularity**:  
  All fasteners are hidden beneath the acrylic panel, allowing quick assembly/disassembly without visual clutter.

- **Concealment Strategy**:  
  The offset acrylic panel design was a key decision to ensure that the device surface appeared clean and professional, ideal for exposed machine faces or control panels.
