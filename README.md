## üìê CAD Drawings

### **1. Long Aluminum Side**

![Long Side Drawing](cad_drawings/long_aluminum_side_drawing.png)

Displays front and isometric views of the longer aluminum enclosure side.

- Mounting slots for attachment to device.
- Material-reducing cutouts to lower weight while retaining stiffness.
- Threaded holes for bolting to the short side.

### **2. Short Aluminum Side**

![Short Side Drawing](cad_drawings/short_aluminum_side_drawing.png)

Front and isometric views of the smaller housing section with:

- Central through-hole for E-stop pushbutton (22.5‚ÄØmm diameter).
- Tapped holes for connecting to the long side.
- Reinforced aluminum edges for CNC milling tolerances.

## üñºÔ∏è Rendered Images

### **1. Acrylic Cover ‚Äì Isometric View**

![Acrylic Cover](images/acrylic_cover_iso.png)

- Laser-cut acrylic plate designed to match aluminum geometry.
- Connected using offset standoffs to conceal internals.

---

### **2. Full Assembly ‚Äì Isometric View**

![Full Assembly](images/full_assembly_iso.png)

- Shows integration of E-stop button, aluminum housing, and acrylic panel.
- Color-coded for part clarity (aluminum = pink, acrylic = gray, button = red).

### **3. Top View ‚Äì Standoff Alignment**

![Top View](images/top_view_standoff_alignment.png)

- Cross-section reveals internal standoffs.
- Shows how cover plate aligns precisely with aluminum side using spacers and screws.

## üî© Design Considerations

- **Material**: 6061-T6 Aluminum for strength, machinability, and corrosion resistance.
- **Fabrication**: Split into two CNC-machinable sections for simplified tooling and fixturing.
- **Aesthetics**: Only the red pushbutton is visible when installed ‚Äî no bolts or wiring are exposed.
- **Safety**: The enclosure is tamper-resistant while still allowing fast access to the E-stop button.
- **Tolerance**: All fits were modeled with standard H7/h6 tolerance range for press and clearance fits.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

- Add cable passthrough grommet on rear side to prevent wire strain.
- Consider switching from screws to dovetail interlock to reduce hardware.
- Potentially use anodized aluminum for improved wear resistance and appearance.
